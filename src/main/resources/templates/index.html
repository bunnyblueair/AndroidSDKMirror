                                    the "SDK" and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and
                                    Google APIs add-ons) is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License
                                    Agreement. The License Agreement forms a legally binding contract between you and
                                    Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

                                    1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under
                                    the Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:

                                    1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with
                                    the Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android
                                    compatibility website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be
                                    updated from time to time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility

                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
                                    2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may
                                    not use the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

                                    2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

                                    2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a
                                    person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other
                                    countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the
                                    SDK.

                                    2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your
                                    employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal
                                    authority to bind your employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do
                                    not have the requisite authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use
                                    the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">3. SDK License from Google</h3>
                                    3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited,
                                    worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable
                                    license to use the SDK solely to develop applications for compatible implementations
                                    of Android.

                                    3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
                                    non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of
                                    course free to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible
                                    implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

                                    3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest
                                    in and to the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the
                                    SDK. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law,
                                    copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary
                                    rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.

                                    3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
                                    Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may
                                    not copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile,
                                    reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of
                                    the SDK.

                                    3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an
                                    open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source
                                    software license and not the License Agreement.

                                    3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change
                                    without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible
                                    with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google
                                    may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the
                                    SDK) to you or to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice
                                    to you.

                                    3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade
                                    names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand
                                    features.

                                    3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights
                                    notices (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or
                                    contained within the SDK.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
                                    4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your
                                    licensors) under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you
                                    develop using the SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in
                                    those applications.

                                    4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are
                                    permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or
                                    generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including
                                    any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or
                                    other relevant countries).

                                    4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public
                                    users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users
                                    provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal
                                    information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to
                                    your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and
                                    protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
                                    information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your
                                    application with Google Account information, your application may only use that
                                    information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes
                                    for which, the user has given you permission to do so.

                                    4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
                                    development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts,
                                    damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other
                                    properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or
                                    any mobile communications carrier.

                                    4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                                    responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources
                                    that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for
                                    Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage
                                    which Google may suffer) by doing so.

                                    4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                                    responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations
                                    under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of
                                    Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including
                                    any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.

                                    5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any
                                    developer credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose
                                    yourself and that you will be solely responsible for all applications that are
                                    developed under your developer credentials.

                                    6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain
                                    usage statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier,
                                    associated IP address, version number of the software, and information on which
                                    tools and/or services in the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before
                                    any of this information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent.
                                    If you withhold consent, the information will not be collected.

                                    6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is
                                    maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.

                                    7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access
                                    data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not
                                    responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that
                                    all data, content or resources which you may access through such third party
                                    applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated
                                    and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience as a
                                    result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content,
                                    or resources.

                                    7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through
                                    such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights
                                    which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).
                                    You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works
                                    based on these data, content, or resources (either in whole or in part) unless you
                                    have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant owners.

                                    7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content,
                                    or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
                                    party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship
                                    with these third parties.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">8. Using Android APIs</h3>
                                    8.1 Google Data APIs

                                    8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data
                                    may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those
                                    parties that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).
                                    Your use of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not
                                    modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this
                                    data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

                                    8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and
                                    agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only
                                    when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to
                                    do so.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
                                    9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or
                                    Google as set out below.

                                    9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your
                                    use of the SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

                                    9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
                                    (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
                                    (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
                                    (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you
                                    has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the
                                    SDK to you; or
                                    (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users
                                    in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the
                                    provision of the SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole
                                    discretion, no longer commercially viable.

                                    9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations
                                    and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which
                                    have accrued over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are
                                    expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the
                                    provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and
                                    liabilities indefinitely.

                                    13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions
                                    of the SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the
                                    License Agreement available on the website where the SDK is made available.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">14. General Legal Terms</h3>
                                    14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and
                                    Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may
                                    provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replaces any
                                    prior agreements between you and Google in relation to the SDK.

                                    14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy
                                    which is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of
                                    under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's
                                    rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

                                    14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules
                                    that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be
                                    removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License
                                    Agreement. The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
                                    valid and enforceable.

                                    14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which
                                    Google is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and
                                    that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
                                    provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of)
                                    them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries
                                    to the License Agreement.

                                    14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND
                                    REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND
                                    REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS,
                                    END USERS AND END USE.

                                    14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred
                                    by either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party.
                                    Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or
                                    obligations under the License Agreement without the prior written approval of the
                                    other party.

                                    14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License
                                    Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard
                                    to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive
                                    jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to
                                    resolve any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this,
                                    you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an
                                    equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

                                    Conditions</h2>
                                    This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">1. Introduction</h3>
                                    1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as
                                    the "SDK" and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and
                                    Google APIs add-ons) is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License
                                    Agreement. The License Agreement forms a legally binding contract between you and
                                    Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

                                    1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under
                                    the Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
                                    http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

                                    1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with
                                    the Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android
                                    compatibility website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be

                                    1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of
                                    business at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
                                    2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may
                                    not use the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

                                    2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

                                    2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a
                                    person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other
                                    countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the
                                    SDK.

                                    2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your
                                    employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal
                                    authority to bind your employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do
                                    not have the requisite authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use
                                    the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">3. SDK License from Google</h3>
                                    3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited,
                                    worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable
                                    license to use the SDK solely to develop applications for compatible implementations
                                    of Android.

                                    3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
                                    non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of
                                    course free to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible
                                    implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

                                    3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest
                                    in and to the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the
                                    SDK. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law,
                                    copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary
                                    rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.

                                    3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
                                    Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may
                                    not copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile,
                                    reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of
                                    the SDK.

                                    3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an
                                    open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source
                                    software license and not the License Agreement.

                                    3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change
                                    without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible
                                    with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google
                                    may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the
                                    SDK) to you or to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice
                                    to you.

                                    3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade
                                    names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand
                                    features.

                                    3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights
                                    notices (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or
                                    contained within the SDK.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
                                    4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your
                                    licensors) under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you
                                    develop using the SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in
                                    those applications.

                                    4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are
                                    permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or
                                    generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including
                                    any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or
                                    other relevant countries).

                                    4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public
                                    users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users
                                    provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal
                                    information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to
                                    your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and
                                    protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
                                    information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your
                                    application with Google Account information, your application may only use that
                                    information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes
                                    for which, the user has given you permission to do so.

                                    4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
                                    development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts,
                                    damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other
                                    properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or
                                    any mobile communications carrier.

                                    4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                                    responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources
                                    that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for
                                    Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage
                                    which Google may suffer) by doing so.

                                    4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                                    responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations
                                    under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of
                                    Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including
                                    any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
                                    5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any
                                    developer credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose
                                    yourself and that you will be solely responsible for all applications that are
                                    developed under your developer credentials.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">6. Privacy and Information</h3>
                                    6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain
                                    usage statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier,
                                    associated IP address, version number of the software, and information on which
                                    tools and/or services in the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before
                                    any of this information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent.
                                    If you withhold consent, the information will not be collected.

                                    6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is
                                    maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">7. Third Party Applications</h3>
                                    7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access
                                    data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not
                                    responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that
                                    all data, content or resources which you may access through such third party
                                    applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated
                                    and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience as a
                                    result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content,
                                    or resources.

                                    7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through
                                    such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights
                                    which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).
                                    You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works
                                    based on these data, content, or resources (either in whole or in part) unless you
                                    have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant owners.

                                    7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content,
                                    or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
                                    party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship
                                    with these third parties.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">8. Using Android APIs</h3>
                                    8.1 Google Data APIs

                                    8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data
                                    may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those
                                    parties that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).
                                    Your use of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not
                                    modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this
                                    data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

                                    8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and
                                    agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only
                                    when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to
                                    do so.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
                                    9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or
                                    Google as set out below.

                                    9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your
                                    use of the SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

                                    9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
                                    (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
                                    (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
                                    (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you
                                    has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the
                                    SDK to you; or
                                    (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users
                                    in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the
                                    provision of the SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole
                                    discretion, no longer commercially viable.

                                    9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations
                                    and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which
                                    have accrued over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are
                                    expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the
                                    provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and
                                    liabilities indefinitely.

                                    12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
                                    harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees
                                    and agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as
                                    well as any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including
                                    reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK,
                                    (b) any application you develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark,

                                    or defames any person or violates their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any

                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
                                    13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions
                                    of the SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the
                                    License Agreement available on the website where the SDK is made available.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">14. General Legal Terms</h3>
                                    14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and
                                    Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may
                                    provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replaces any
                                    prior agreements between you and Google in relation to the SDK.

                                    14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy
                                    which is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of
                                    under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's
                                    rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

                                    14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules
                                    that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be
                                    removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License
                                    Agreement. The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
                                    valid and enforceable.

                                    14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which
                                    Google is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and
                                    that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
                                    provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of)
                                    them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries
                                    to the License Agreement.

                                    14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND
                                    REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND
                                    REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS,
                                    END USERS AND END USE.

                                    14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred
                                    by either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party.
                                    Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or
                                    obligations under the License Agreement without the prior written approval of the
                                    other party.

                                    14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License
                                    Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard
                                    to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive
                                    jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to
                                    resolve any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this,
                                    you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an
                                    equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

                                    2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

                                    2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a
                                    person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other
                                    countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the
                                    SDK.

                                    2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your
                                    employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal
                                    authority to bind your employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do
                                    not have the requisite authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use
                                    the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.

                                    3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited,
                                    worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable

                                    of Android.

                                    3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
                                    non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of
                                    course free to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible
                                    implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

                                    3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest
                                    in and to the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the
                                    SDK. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law,
                                    copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary
                                    rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.

                                    3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
                                    Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may
                                    not copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile,
                                    reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of
                                    the SDK.

                                    3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an
                                    open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source
                                    software license and not the License Agreement.

                                    3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change
                                    without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible
                                    with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google
                                    may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the
                                    SDK) to you or to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice
                                    to you.

                                    3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade
                                    names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand
                                    features.

                                    3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights
                                    notices (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or
                                    contained within the SDK.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
                                    4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your
                                    licensors) under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you
                                    develop using the SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in
                                    those applications.

                                    4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are
                                    permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or
                                    generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including
                                    any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or
                                    other relevant countries).

                                    4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public
                                    users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users
                                    provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal
                                    information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to
                                    your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and
                                    protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
                                    information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your
                                    application with Google Account information, your application may only use that
                                    information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes
                                    for which, the user has given you permission to do so.

                                    4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
                                    development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts,
                                    damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other
                                    properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or
                                    any mobile communications carrier.

                                    4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                                    responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources
                                    that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for
                                    Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage
                                    which Google may suffer) by doing so.

                                    4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                                    responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations
                                    under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of
                                    Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including
                                    any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
                                    5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any
                                    developer credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose
                                    yourself and that you will be solely responsible for all applications that are
                                    developed under your developer credentials.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">6. Privacy and Information</h3>
                                    6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain
                                    usage statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier,
                                    associated IP address, version number of the software, and information on which
                                    tools and/or services in the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before
                                    any of this information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent.
                                    If you withhold consent, the information will not be collected.

                                    6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is
                                    maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">7. Third Party Applications</h3>
                                    7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access
                                    data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not
                                    responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that
                                    all data, content or resources which you may access through such third party
                                    applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated
                                    and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience as a
                                    result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content,
                                    or resources.

                                    7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through
                                    such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights
                                    which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).
                                    You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works
                                    based on these data, content, or resources (either in whole or in part) unless you
                                    have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant owners.

                                    7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content,
                                    or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
                                    party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship
                                    with these third parties.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">8. Using Android APIs</h3>
                                    8.1 Google Data APIs

                                    8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data
                                    may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those
                                    parties that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).
                                    Your use of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not
                                    modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this
                                    data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

                                    8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and
                                    agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only
                                    when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to
                                    do so.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
                                    9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or
                                    Google as set out below.

                                    9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your
                                    use of the SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

                                    9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
                                    (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
                                    (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
                                    (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you
                                    has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the
                                    SDK to you; or
                                    (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users
                                    in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the
                                    provision of the SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole
                                    discretion, no longer commercially viable.

                                    9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations
                                    and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which
                                    have accrued over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are
                                    expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the
                                    provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and
                                    liabilities indefinitely.

                                    11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND
                                    AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF
                                    LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY
                                    DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT
                                    GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE
                                    POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">12. Indemnification</h3>
                                    12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
                                    harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees
                                    and agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as
                                    well as any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including
                                    reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK,
                                    (b) any application you develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark,
                                    trade secret, trade dress, patent or other intellectual property right of any person
                                    or defames any person or violates their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any
                                    non-compliance by you with the License Agreement.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
                                    13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions
                                    of the SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the
                                    License Agreement available on the website where the SDK is made available.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">14. General Legal Terms</h3>
                                    14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and
                                    Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may
                                    provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replaces any
                                    prior agreements between you and Google in relation to the SDK.

                                    14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy
                                    which is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of
                                    under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's
                                    rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

                                    14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules
                                    that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be
                                    removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License
                                    Agreement. The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
                                    valid and enforceable.

                                    14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which
                                    Google is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and
                                    that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
                                    provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of)
                                    them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries
                                    to the License Agreement.

                                    14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND
                                    REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND
                                    REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS,
                                    END USERS AND END USE.

                                    14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred
                                    by either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party.
                                    Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or
                                    obligations under the License Agreement without the prior written approval of the
                                    other party.

                                    14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License
                                    Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard
                                    to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive
                                    jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to
                                    resolve any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this,
                                    you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an
                                    equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

                                    This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">1. Introduction</h3>
                                    1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as
                                    the "SDK" and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and
                                    Google APIs add-ons) is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License
                                    Agreement. The License Agreement forms a legally binding contract between you and
                                    Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

                                    1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under
                                    the Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
                                    http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

                                    1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with
                                    the Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android
                                    compatibility website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be
                                    updated from time to time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility
                                    Test Suite (CTS).

                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
                                    2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may
                                    not use the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

                                    2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

                                    2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a
                                    person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other
                                    countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the
                                    SDK.

                                    2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your
                                    employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal
                                    authority to bind your employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do
                                    not have the requisite authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use
                                    the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">3. SDK License from Google</h3>
                                    3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited,
                                    worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable
                                    license to use the SDK solely to develop applications for compatible implementations
                                    of Android.

                                    3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
                                    non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of
                                    course free to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible
                                    implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

                                    3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest
                                    in and to the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the
                                    SDK. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law,
                                    copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary
                                    rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.

                                    3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
                                    Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may
                                    not copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile,
                                    reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of
                                    the SDK.

                                    3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an
                                    open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source
                                    software license and not the License Agreement.

                                    3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change
                                    without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible
                                    with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google
                                    may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the
                                    SDK) to you or to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice
                                    to you.

                                    3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade
                                    names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand
                                    features.

                                    3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights
                                    notices (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or
                                    contained within the SDK.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
                                    4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your
                                    licensors) under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you
                                    develop using the SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in
                                    those applications.

                                    4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are
                                    permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or
                                    generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including
                                    any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or
                                    other relevant countries).

                                    4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public
                                    users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users
                                    provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal
                                    information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to
                                    your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and
                                    protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
                                    information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your
                                    application with Google Account information, your application may only use that
                                    information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes
                                    for which, the user has given you permission to do so.

                                    4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
                                    development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts,
                                    damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other
                                    properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or
                                    any mobile communications carrier.

                                    4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                                    responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources
                                    that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for
                                    Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage
                                    which Google may suffer) by doing so.

                                    4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                                    responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations
                                    under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of

                                    any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.

                                    developer credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose
                                    yourself and that you will be solely responsible for all applications that are

                                    6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain
                                    usage statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier,
                                    associated IP address, version number of the software, and information on which
                                    tools and/or services in the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before
                                    any of this information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent.
                                    If you withhold consent, the information will not be collected.

                                    6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is
                                    maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.

                                    7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access
                                    data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not
                                    responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that
                                    all data, content or resources which you may access through such third party
                                    applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated
                                    and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience as a
                                    result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content,
                                    or resources.

                                    7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through
                                    such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights
                                    which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).
                                    You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works
                                    based on these data, content, or resources (either in whole or in part) unless you
                                    have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant owners.

                                    7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content,
                                    or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
                                    party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship
                                    with these third parties.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">8. Using Android APIs</h3>
                                    8.1 Google Data APIs

                                    8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data
                                    may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those
                                    parties that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).
                                    Your use of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not
                                    modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this
                                    data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

                                    8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and
                                    agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only
                                    when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to
                                    do so.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
                                    9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or
                                    Google as set out below.

                                    9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your
                                    use of the SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

                                    9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
                                    (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
                                    (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
                                    (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you
                                    has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the
                                    SDK to you; or
                                    (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users
                                    in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the
                                    provision of the SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole
                                    discretion, no longer commercially viable.

                                    9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations
                                    and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which
                                    have accrued over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are
                                    expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the
                                    provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and
                                    liabilities indefinitely.

                                    13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions
                                    of the SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the
                                    License Agreement available on the website where the SDK is made available.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">14. General Legal Terms</h3>
                                    14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and
                                    Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may
                                    provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replaces any
                                    prior agreements between you and Google in relation to the SDK.

                                    14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy
                                    which is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of
                                    under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's
                                    rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

                                    14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules
                                    that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be
                                    removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License
                                    Agreement. The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
                                    valid and enforceable.

                                    14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which
                                    Google is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and
                                    that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
                                    provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of)
                                    them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries
                                    to the License Agreement.

                                    14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND
                                    REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND
                                    REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS,
                                    END USERS AND END USE.

                                    14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred
                                    by either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party.
                                    Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or
                                    obligations under the License Agreement without the prior written approval of the
                                    other party.

                                    14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License
                                    Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard
                                    to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive
                                    jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to
                                    resolve any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this,
                                    you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an
                                    equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

                                    This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">1. Introduction</h3>
                                    1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as
                                    the "SDK" and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and
                                    Google APIs add-ons) is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License
                                    Agreement. The License Agreement forms a legally binding contract between you and
                                    Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

                                    1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under
                                    the Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
                                    http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

                                    1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with
                                    the Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android
                                    compatibility website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be

                                    1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of
                                    business at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
                                    2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may
                                    not use the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

                                    2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

                                    2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a
                                    person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other
                                    countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the
                                    SDK.

                                    2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your
                                    employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal
                                    authority to bind your employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do
                                    not have the requisite authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use
                                    the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">3. SDK License from Google</h3>
                                    3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited,
                                    worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable
                                    license to use the SDK solely to develop applications for compatible implementations
                                    of Android.

                                    3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
                                    non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of
                                    course free to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible
                                    implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

                                    3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest
                                    in and to the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the
                                    SDK. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law,
                                    copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary
                                    rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.

                                    3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
                                    Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may
                                    not copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile,
                                    reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of
                                    the SDK.

                                    3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an
                                    open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source
                                    software license and not the License Agreement.

                                    3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change
                                    without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible
                                    with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google
                                    may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the
                                    SDK) to you or to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice
                                    to you.

                                    3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade
                                    names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand
                                    features.

                                    3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights
                                    notices (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or
                                    contained within the SDK.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
                                    4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your
                                    licensors) under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you
                                    develop using the SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in
                                    those applications.

                                    4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are
                                    permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or
                                    generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including
                                    any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or
                                    other relevant countries).

                                    4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public
                                    users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users
                                    provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal
                                    information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to
                                    your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and
                                    protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
                                    information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your
                                    application with Google Account information, your application may only use that
                                    information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes
                                    for which, the user has given you permission to do so.

                                    4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
                                    development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts,
                                    damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other
                                    properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or
                                    any mobile communications carrier.

                                    4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                                    responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources
                                    that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for
                                    Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage
                                    which Google may suffer) by doing so.

                                    4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                                    responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations
                                    under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of
                                    Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including
                                    any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
                                    5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any
                                    developer credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose
                                    yourself and that you will be solely responsible for all applications that are
                                    developed under your developer credentials.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">6. Privacy and Information</h3>
                                    6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain
                                    usage statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier,
                                    associated IP address, version number of the software, and information on which
                                    tools and/or services in the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before
                                    any of this information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent.
                                    If you withhold consent, the information will not be collected.

                                    6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is
                                    maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">7. Third Party Applications</h3>
                                    7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access
                                    data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not
                                    responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that
                                    all data, content or resources which you may access through such third party
                                    applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated
                                    and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience as a
                                    result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content,
                                    or resources.

                                    7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through
                                    such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights
                                    which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).
                                    You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works
                                    based on these data, content, or resources (either in whole or in part) unless you
                                    have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant owners.

                                    7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content,
                                    or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
                                    party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship
                                    with these third parties.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">8. Using Android APIs</h3>
                                    8.1 Google Data APIs

                                    8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data
                                    may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those
                                    parties that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).
                                    Your use of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not
                                    modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this
                                    data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

                                    8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and
                                    agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only
                                    when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to
                                    do so.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
                                    9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or
                                    Google as set out below.

                                    9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your
                                    use of the SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

                                    9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
                                    (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
                                    (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
                                    (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you
                                    has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the
                                    SDK to you; or
                                    (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users
                                    in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the
                                    provision of the SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole
                                    discretion, no longer commercially viable.

                                    9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations
                                    and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which
                                    have accrued over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are
                                    expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the
                                    provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and
                                    liabilities indefinitely.

                                    12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
                                    harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees

                                    (b) any application you develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark,

                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
                                    13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions
                                    of the SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the
                                    License Agreement available on the website where the SDK is made available.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">14. General Legal Terms</h3>
                                    14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and
                                    Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may
                                    provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replaces any
                                    prior agreements between you and Google in relation to the SDK.

                                    14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy
                                    which is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of
                                    under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's
                                    rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

                                    14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules
                                    that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be
                                    removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License
                                    Agreement. The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
                                    valid and enforceable.

                                    14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which
                                    Google is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and
                                    that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
                                    provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of)
                                    them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries
                                    to the License Agreement.

                                    14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND
                                    REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND
                                    REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS,
                                    END USERS AND END USE.

                                    14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred
                                    by either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party.
                                    Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or
                                    obligations under the License Agreement without the prior written approval of the
                                    other party.

                                    14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License
                                    Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard
                                    to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive
                                    jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to
                                    resolve any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this,
                                    you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an
                                    equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

                                    2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may
                                    not use the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

                                    2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

                                    2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a
                                    person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other
                                    countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the
                                    SDK.

                                    2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your
                                    employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal
                                    authority to bind your employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do
                                    not have the requisite authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use
                                    the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.

                                    3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited,
                                    worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable

                                    of Android.

                                    3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
                                    non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of
                                    course free to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible
                                    implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

                                    3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest
                                    in and to the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the
                                    SDK. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law,
                                    copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary
                                    rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.

                                    3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
                                    Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may
                                    not copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile,
                                    reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of
                                    the SDK.

                                    3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an
                                    open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source
                                    software license and not the License Agreement.

                                    3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change
                                    without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible
                                    with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google
                                    may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the
                                    SDK) to you or to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice
                                    to you.

                                    3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade
                                    names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand
                                    features.

                                    3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights
                                    notices (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or
                                    contained within the SDK.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
                                    4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your
                                    licensors) under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you
                                    develop using the SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in
                                    those applications.

                                    4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are
                                    permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or
                                    generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including
                                    any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or
                                    other relevant countries).

                                    4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public
                                    users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users
                                    provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal
                                    information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to
                                    your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and
                                    protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
                                    information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your
                                    application with Google Account information, your application may only use that
                                    information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes
                                    for which, the user has given you permission to do so.

                                    4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
                                    development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts,
                                    damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other
                                    properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or
                                    any mobile communications carrier.

                                    4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                                    responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources
                                    that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for
                                    Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage
                                    which Google may suffer) by doing so.

                                    4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                                    responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations
                                    under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of
                                    Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including
                                    any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
                                    5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any
                                    developer credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose
                                    yourself and that you will be solely responsible for all applications that are
                                    developed under your developer credentials.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">6. Privacy and Information</h3>
                                    6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain
                                    usage statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier,
                                    associated IP address, version number of the software, and information on which
                                    tools and/or services in the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before
                                    any of this information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent.
                                    If you withhold consent, the information will not be collected.

                                    6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is
                                    maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">7. Third Party Applications</h3>
                                    7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access
                                    data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not
                                    responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that
                                    all data, content or resources which you may access through such third party
                                    applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated
                                    and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience as a
                                    result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content,
                                    or resources.

                                    7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through
                                    such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights
                                    which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).
                                    You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works
                                    based on these data, content, or resources (either in whole or in part) unless you
                                    have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant owners.

                                    7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content,
                                    or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
                                    party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship
                                    with these third parties.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">8. Using Android APIs</h3>
                                    8.1 Google Data APIs

                                    8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data
                                    may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those
                                    parties that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).
                                    Your use of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not
                                    modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this
                                    data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

                                    8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and
                                    agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only
                                    when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to
                                    do so.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
                                    9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or
                                    Google as set out below.

                                    9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your
                                    use of the SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

                                    9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
                                    (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
                                    (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
                                    (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you
                                    has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the
                                    SDK to you; or
                                    (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users
                                    in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the
                                    provision of the SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole
                                    discretion, no longer commercially viable.

                                    9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations
                                    and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which
                                    have accrued over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are
                                    expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the
                                    provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and
                                    liabilities indefinitely.

                                    11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND
                                    AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF
                                    LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY
                                    DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT
                                    GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE
                                    POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">12. Indemnification</h3>
                                    12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
                                    harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees
                                    and agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as
                                    well as any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including
                                    reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK,
                                    (b) any application you develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark,
                                    trade secret, trade dress, patent or other intellectual property right of any person
                                    or defames any person or violates their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any
                                    non-compliance by you with the License Agreement.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
                                    13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions
                                    of the SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the
                                    License Agreement available on the website where the SDK is made available.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">14. General Legal Terms</h3>
                                    14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and
                                    Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may
                                    provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replaces any
                                    prior agreements between you and Google in relation to the SDK.

                                    14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy
                                    which is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of
                                    under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's
                                    rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

                                    14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules
                                    that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be
                                    removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License
                                    Agreement. The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
                                    valid and enforceable.

                                    14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which
                                    Google is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and
                                    that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
                                    provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of)
                                    them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries
                                    to the License Agreement.

                                    14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND
                                    REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND
                                    REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS,
                                    END USERS AND END USE.

                                    14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred
                                    by either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party.
                                    Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or
                                    obligations under the License Agreement without the prior written approval of the
                                    other party.

                                    14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License
                                    Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard
                                    to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive
                                    jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to
                                    resolve any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this,
                                    you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an
                                    equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

                                    This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">1. Introduction</h3>
                                    1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as
                                    the "SDK" and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and
                                    Google APIs add-ons) is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License
                                    Agreement. The License Agreement forms a legally binding contract between you and
                                    Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

                                    1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under
                                    the Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
                                    http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

                                    1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with
                                    the Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android
                                    compatibility website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be
                                    updated from time to time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility
                                    Test Suite (CTS).

                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
                                    2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may
                                    not use the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

                                    2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

                                    2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a
                                    person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other
                                    countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the
                                    SDK.

                                    2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your
                                    employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal
                                    authority to bind your employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do
                                    not have the requisite authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use
                                    the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">3. SDK License from Google</h3>
                                    3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited,
                                    worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable
                                    license to use the SDK solely to develop applications for compatible implementations
                                    of Android.

                                    3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
                                    non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of
                                    course free to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible
                                    implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

                                    3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest
                                    in and to the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the
                                    SDK. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law,
                                    copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary
                                    rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.

                                    3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
                                    Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may
                                    not copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile,
                                    reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of
                                    the SDK.

                                    3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an
                                    open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source
                                    software license and not the License Agreement.

                                    3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change
                                    without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible
                                    with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google
                                    may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the
                                    SDK) to you or to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice
                                    to you.

                                    3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade
                                    names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand
                                    features.

                                    3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights
                                    notices (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or
                                    contained within the SDK.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
                                    4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your
                                    licensors) under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you
                                    develop using the SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in
                                    those applications.

                                    4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are
                                    permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or
                                    generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including
                                    any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or
                                    other relevant countries).

                                    4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public
                                    users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users
                                    provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal
                                    information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to
                                    your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and
                                    protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
                                    information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your
                                    application with Google Account information, your application may only use that
                                    information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes
                                    for which, the user has given you permission to do so.

                                    4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
                                    development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts,
                                    damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other
                                    properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or
                                    any mobile communications carrier.

                                    4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                                    responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources
                                    that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for
                                    Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage
                                    which Google may suffer) by doing so.

                                    4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                                    responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations
                                    under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of

                                    any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.

                                    developer credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose
                                    yourself and that you will be solely responsible for all applications that are

                                    6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain
                                    usage statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier,
                                    associated IP address, version number of the software, and information on which
                                    tools and/or services in the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before
                                    any of this information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent.
                                    If you withhold consent, the information will not be collected.

                                    6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is
                                    maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.

                                    7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access
                                    data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not
                                    responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that
                                    all data, content or resources which you may access through such third party
                                    applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated
                                    and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience as a
                                    result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content,
                                    or resources.

                                    7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through
                                    such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights
                                    which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).
                                    You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works
                                    based on these data, content, or resources (either in whole or in part) unless you
                                    have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant owners.

                                    7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content,
                                    or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
                                    party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship
                                    with these third parties.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">8. Using Android APIs</h3>
                                    8.1 Google Data APIs

                                    8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data
                                    may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those
                                    parties that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).
                                    Your use of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not
                                    modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this
                                    data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

                                    8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and
                                    agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only
                                    when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to
                                    do so.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
                                    9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or
                                    Google as set out below.

                                    9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your
                                    use of the SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

                                    9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
                                    (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
                                    (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
                                    (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you
                                    has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the
                                    SDK to you; or
                                    (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users
                                    in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the
                                    provision of the SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole
                                    discretion, no longer commercially viable.

                                    9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations
                                    and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which
                                    have accrued over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are
                                    expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the
                                    provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and
                                    liabilities indefinitely.

                                    13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions
                                    of the SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the
                                    License Agreement available on the website where the SDK is made available.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">14. General Legal Terms</h3>
                                    14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and
                                    Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may
                                    provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replaces any
                                    prior agreements between you and Google in relation to the SDK.

                                    14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy
                                    which is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of
                                    under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's
                                    rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

                                    14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules
                                    that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be
                                    removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License
                                    Agreement. The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
                                    valid and enforceable.

                                    14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which
                                    Google is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and
                                    that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
                                    provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of)
                                    them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries
                                    to the License Agreement.

                                    14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND
                                    REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND
                                    REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS,
                                    END USERS AND END USE.

                                    14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred
                                    by either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party.
                                    Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or
                                    obligations under the License Agreement without the prior written approval of the
                                    other party.

                                    14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License
                                    Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard
                                    to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive
                                    jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to
                                    resolve any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this,
                                    you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an
                                    equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

                                    This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">1. Introduction</h3>
                                    1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as
                                    the "SDK" and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and
                                    Google APIs add-ons) is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License
                                    Agreement. The License Agreement forms a legally binding contract between you and
                                    Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

                                    1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under
                                    the Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
                                    http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

                                    1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with
                                    the Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android
                                    compatibility website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be

                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
                                    2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may
                                    not use the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

                                    2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

                                    2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a
                                    person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other
                                    countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the
                                    SDK.

                                    2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your
                                    employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal
                                    authority to bind your employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do
                                    not have the requisite authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use
                                    the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">3. SDK License from Google</h3>
                                    3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited,
                                    worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable
                                    license to use the SDK solely to develop applications for compatible implementations
                                    of Android.

                                    3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
                                    non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of
                                    course free to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible
                                    implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

                                    3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest
                                    in and to the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the
                                    SDK. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law,
                                    copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary
                                    rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.

                                    3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
                                    Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may
                                    not copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile,
                                    reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of
                                    the SDK.

                                    3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an
                                    open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source
                                    software license and not the License Agreement.

                                    3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change
                                    without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible
                                    with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google
                                    may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the
                                    SDK) to you or to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice
                                    to you.

                                    3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade
                                    names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand
                                    features.

                                    3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights
                                    notices (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or
                                    contained within the SDK.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
                                    4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your
                                    licensors) under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you
                                    develop using the SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in
                                    those applications.

                                    4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are
                                    permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or
                                    generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including
                                    any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or
                                    other relevant countries).

                                    4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public
                                    users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users
                                    provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal
                                    information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to
                                    your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and
                                    protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
                                    information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your
                                    application with Google Account information, your application may only use that
                                    information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes
                                    for which, the user has given you permission to do so.

                                    4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
                                    development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts,
                                    damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other
                                    properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or
                                    any mobile communications carrier.

                                    4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                                    responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources
                                    that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for
                                    Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage
                                    which Google may suffer) by doing so.

                                    4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                                    responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations
                                    under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of
                                    Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including
                                    any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
                                    5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any
                                    developer credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose
                                    yourself and that you will be solely responsible for all applications that are
                                    developed under your developer credentials.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">6. Privacy and Information</h3>
                                    6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain
                                    usage statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier,
                                    associated IP address, version number of the software, and information on which
                                    tools and/or services in the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before
                                    any of this information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent.
                                    If you withhold consent, the information will not be collected.

                                    6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is
                                    maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">7. Third Party Applications</h3>
                                    7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access
                                    data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not
                                    responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that
                                    all data, content or resources which you may access through such third party
                                    applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated
                                    and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience as a
                                    result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content,
                                    or resources.

                                    7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through
                                    such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights
                                    which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).
                                    You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works
                                    based on these data, content, or resources (either in whole or in part) unless you
                                    have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant owners.

                                    7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content,
                                    or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
                                    party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship
                                    with these third parties.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">8. Using Android APIs</h3>
                                    8.1 Google Data APIs

                                    8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data
                                    may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those
                                    parties that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).
                                    Your use of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not
                                    modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this
                                    data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

                                    8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and
                                    agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only
                                    when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to
                                    do so.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
                                    9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or
                                    Google as set out below.

                                    9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your
                                    use of the SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

                                    9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
                                    (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
                                    (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
                                    (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you
                                    has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the
                                    SDK to you; or
                                    (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users
                                    in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the
                                    provision of the SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole
                                    discretion, no longer commercially viable.

                                    9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations
                                    and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which
                                    have accrued over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are
                                    expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the
                                    provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and
                                    liabilities indefinitely.

                                    AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF

                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">12. Indemnification</h3>
                                    12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
                                    harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees
                                    and agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as

                                    (b) any application you develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark,

                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
                                    13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions
                                    of the SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the
                                    License Agreement available on the website where the SDK is made available.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">14. General Legal Terms</h3>
                                    14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and
                                    Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may
                                    provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replaces any
                                    prior agreements between you and Google in relation to the SDK.

                                    14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy
                                    which is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of
                                    under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's
                                    rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

                                    14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules
                                    that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be
                                    removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License
                                    Agreement. The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
                                    valid and enforceable.

                                    14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which
                                    Google is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and
                                    that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
                                    provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of)
                                    them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries
                                    to the License Agreement.

                                    14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND
                                    REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND
                                    REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS,
                                    END USERS AND END USE.

                                    14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred
                                    by either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party.
                                    Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or
                                    obligations under the License Agreement without the prior written approval of the
                                    other party.

                                    14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License
                                    Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard
                                    to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive
                                    jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to
                                    resolve any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this,
                                    you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an
                                    equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

                                    2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may

                                    2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

                                    2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a
                                    person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other
                                    countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the
                                    SDK.

                                    2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your

                                    3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited,
                                    worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable

                                    of Android.

                                    3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
                                    non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of
                                    course free to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible
                                    implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

                                    3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest
                                    in and to the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the
                                    SDK. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law,
                                    copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary
                                    rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.

                                    3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
                                    Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may
                                    not copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile,
                                    reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of
                                    the SDK.

                                    3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an
                                    open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source
                                    software license and not the License Agreement.

                                    3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change
                                    without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible
                                    with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google
                                    may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the
                                    SDK) to you or to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice
                                    to you.

                                    3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade
                                    names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand
                                    features.

                                    3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights
                                    notices (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or
                                    contained within the SDK.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
                                    4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your
                                    licensors) under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you
                                    develop using the SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in
                                    those applications.

                                    4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are
                                    permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or
                                    generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including
                                    any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or
                                    other relevant countries).

                                    4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public
                                    users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users
                                    provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal
                                    information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to
                                    your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and
                                    protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
                                    information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your
                                    application with Google Account information, your application may only use that
                                    information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes
                                    for which, the user has given you permission to do so.

                                    4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
                                    development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts,
                                    damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other
                                    properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or
                                    any mobile communications carrier.

                                    4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                                    responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources
                                    that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for
                                    Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage
                                    which Google may suffer) by doing so.

                                    4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                                    responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations
                                    under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of
                                    Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including
                                    any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
                                    5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any
                                    developer credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose
                                    yourself and that you will be solely responsible for all applications that are
                                    developed under your developer credentials.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">6. Privacy and Information</h3>
                                    6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain
                                    usage statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier,
                                    associated IP address, version number of the software, and information on which
                                    tools and/or services in the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before
                                    any of this information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent.
                                    If you withhold consent, the information will not be collected.

                                    6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is
                                    maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">7. Third Party Applications</h3>
                                    7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access
                                    data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not

                                    all data, content or resources which you may access through such third party
                                    applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated
                                    and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience as a
                                    result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content,
                                    or resources.

                                    7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through
                                    such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights
                                    which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).
                                    You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works
                                    based on these data, content, or resources (either in whole or in part) unless you
                                    have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant owners.

                                    7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content,
                                    or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third

                                    with these third parties.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">8. Using Android APIs</h3>
                                    8.1 Google Data APIs

                                    8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data
                                    may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those
                                    parties that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).
                                    Your use of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not
                                    modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this
                                    data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

                                    8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and
                                    agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only
                                    when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to
                                    do so.

                                    9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or
                                    Google as set out below.

                                    9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your

                                    9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
                                    (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
                                    (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
                                    (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you
                                    has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the
                                    SDK to you; or
                                    (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users
                                    in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the
                                    provision of the SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole
                                    discretion, no longer commercially viable.

                                    9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations
                                    and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which

                                    expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the
                                    provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and
                                    liabilities indefinitely.

                                    GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE
                                    POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">12. Indemnification</h3>
                                    12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
                                    harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees
                                    and agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as
                                    well as any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including
                                    reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK,
                                    (b) any application you develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark,
                                    trade secret, trade dress, patent or other intellectual property right of any person
                                    or defames any person or violates their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any
                                    non-compliance by you with the License Agreement.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
                                    13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions
                                    of the SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the
                                    License Agreement available on the website where the SDK is made available.


                                    <h3 class="hide-from-toc">14. General Legal Terms</h3>
                                    14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and
                                    Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may
                                    provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replaces any
                                    prior agreements between you and Google in relation to the SDK.

                                    14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy
                                    which is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of
                                    under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's
                                    rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

                                    14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules
                                    that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be
                                    removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License
                                    Agreement. The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
                                    valid and enforceable.

                                    14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which
                                    Google is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and
                                    that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
                                    provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of)
                                    them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries
                                    to the License Agreement.

                                    14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND
                                    REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND
                                    REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS,
                                    END USERS AND END USE.

                                    14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred
                                    by either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party.
                                    Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or
                                    obligations under the License Agreement without the prior written approval of the
                                    other party.

                                    14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License
                                    Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard
                                    to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive
                                    jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to
                                    resolve any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this,
                                    you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an
                                    equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.
